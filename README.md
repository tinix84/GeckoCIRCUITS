This is the source code package of the software GeckoCIRCUITS. GeckoCIRCUITS is a fast circuit simulator which is optimized for applications in power electronics.


## What is GeckoCIRCUITS?
See the [FAQ](FAQ.md) section

## What is this repo?

This is the "official" new GeckoCIRCUITS Github repository, created and maintained by one of the original software authors.
GeckoCIRCUITS was hosted on Sourceforge before [GeckoCircuits](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geckocircuits/).
My friends at [Technokrat](https://github.com/technokrat/gecko) did do some improvements (e.g. support of HiDPI Monitors) to the software, this changes are included in this repo, thanks for this contribution!

## Prerequisites

To build, you need maven 3 installed and a more recent JDK. Everything from JDK9 to JDK13 should work.

## Building

Then run

```
mvn package
mvn package assembly:single
```

This should build the `target/gecko-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar`.
It should have a proper class path set and includes all the dependency libs.

## Running

Run it with

```java -Xmx3G -Dpolyglot.js.nashorn-compat=true -jar target/gecko-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar```

To run on HiDPI screens, use

```java -Xmx3G -Dpolyglot.js.nashorn-compat=true -Dsun.java2d.uiScale=2 -jar target/gecko-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar```

## Tests

As you might have recognized during the build, 11 tests were skipped. Those were excluded as the codebase is hard to read and the tests only seem to fail because of some expectations how the environment should luck which is not given outside Netbeans.

Feel free to fix those tests.

If you would like to simply run the program, and without the intention to change, inspect
the sourcecode or to compile the program from scratch, you should probably download
the binary package, available at www.gecko-simulations.com instead of this sourcecode
package.
